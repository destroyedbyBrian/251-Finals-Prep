// Question 2.1: Basic try-catch
/*
    Write a function `safeDivide` that takes two integers (numerator and
    denominator) as input.  Use a `try-catch` block to handle the potential
    `std::runtime_error` that can occur if the denominator is zero.  If a
    division-by-zero occurs, catch the exception and print an error message.
    Otherwise, return the result of the division.
